# Finite Scan Example

## About
This example demonstrates how to perform a finite acquisition on one or more 
channels.

Analog input data is acquired in blocks for a specified group of channels.

The last sample of data for each channel is displayed for each block of data 
received from the device. The acquisition is stopped when the specified number 
of samples is acquired for each channel or the Enter key is pressed.

This example is compiled and ready-to-run, and can be customized to suit 
your needs.
