********************************
Installing and Using the Library
********************************

The project is hosted at https://github.com/nwright98/daqhats.

Installation
************

1. Power off the Raspberry Pi then attach one or more HAT boards (see :ref:`install`).
2. Power on the Pi and log in.  Open a terminal window if using the graphical interface.
3. If git is not already installed, update installation packages and install it::

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install git
    
4. Download this package to your user folder with git::

    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/nwright98/daqhats
    
5. Build and install the shared library and optional Python support.  The installer will ask if you want to install Python 2 and Python 3 support.  It will also detect the HAT board EEPROMs and save the contents if needed::

    cd ~/daqhats
    sudo ./install.sh

6. [Optional] To update the firmware on your MCC 118 board(s) use the firmware update tool.  The "0" in the example below is the board address.  The line with the "-b" option updates the bootloader.  Repead the two commands for each MCC 118 address in your board stack::

    mcc118_firmware_update -b 0 ~/daqhats/tools/MCC_118.hex
    mcc118_firmware_update 0 ~/daqhats/tools/MCC_118.hex
    
You can now run the example programs under ~/daqhats/examples and create your own programs.

To uninstall the package use::

    cd ~/daqhats
    sudo ./uninstall.sh
    
If you change your board stackup and have more than one HAT board attached you must update the saved EEPROM images for the library to have the correct board information::

    sudo daqhats_read_eeproms
    

Creating a C program
********************

- The daqhats headers are installed in /usr/local/include/daqhats.  Add the compiler option :code:`-I/usr/local/include` in order to find the header files when compiling, and the include line :code:`#include <daqhats/daqhats.h>` to your source code.
- The shared library, libdaqhats.so, is installed in /usr/local/lib.  Add the linker option :code:`-ldaqhats` to include this library.
- Study the example programs, example makefile, and library documentation for more information.

Creating a Python program
*************************

- The Python package is named *daqhats*.  Use it in your code with :code:`import daqhats`.
- Study the example programs and library documentation for more information.
