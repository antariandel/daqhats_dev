Hardware Overview
*****************

The MCC HATs are Raspberry Pi add-on boards (Hardware Attached on Top). They adhere
to the Raspberry Pi HAT specification, but also extend it to allow stacking up to 
8 MCC boards on a single Raspberry Pi.

We provide Python and C libraries, documentation, and examples to allow you to develop
your own applications using our boards.
